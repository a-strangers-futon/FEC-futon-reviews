# Stranger's Futon #
Front-end / UI for a full-stack home rental web app, where users can look at reviews, view pictures, and book a home based on available dates.

The reviews component dynamically renders the number of reviews available and all its ratings out of 5 stars. A user can search reviews based on keywords and sort the order of reviews based on relevancy or recency. The component also implements pagination, so only 7 reviews are rendered on each page.
